    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start preparing ragù by sautéeing pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat renders, 1 to
            2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook, stirring until vegetables have softened, about 5
            minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook while mashing meat into small pieces until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add wine and bring to a boil. Add 1 cup broth and tomato sauce. Reduce heat to low, and partially cover the
            pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer ragù, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Add 1 more cup of broth to ragù. Continue simmering, stirring often, until very thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add
            more broth only if necessary; ragù should drop, not run, off a spoon. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Start preparing pasta after ragù is cooked. Bring water and salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Add spinach,
            cover, and return to a boil. Cook, stirring gently, until spinach is heated through. Remove from heat, leave
            covered, and let cool.</li>
        <li>Drain spinach in a mesh strainer set over a bowl, pressing it down with a fork to squeeze out as much water
            as possible; reserve the liquid. Purée spinach in a blender until smooth.</li>
        <li>Sift flour into a bowl. Make a well in the center. Add eggs, spinach, and about 1 tablespoon of the reserved
            spinach cooking liquid. Mix together by hand or using the dough hook in a stand mixer, adding more liquid if
            needed, until dough becomes a smooth ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Taste the ragù and season with salt. Remove from heat, add milk, and stir to combine. Set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>Divide pasta dough into 4 equal pieces. Use a pasta machine or rolling pin dusted with flour to roll pasta
            into 1/16-inch thick sheets. Lay sheets on clean dish towels to help them dry. Let rest for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, start béchamel sauce by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Do not allow to brown or
            burn. Add flour and whisk constantly until golden. Add 1/2 cup milk, whisking constantly. Repeat with
            remaining milk. Simmer until béchamel is thick, about 10 minutes. Season with nutmeg and salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread a bit of the ragù on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Add a layer of pasta. Top with a spoonful
            of ragù and béchamel. Add a spoonful of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Top with another layer of pasta. Add more ragù,
            béchamel, and cheese. Repeat layers, finishing with a layer of pasta, béchamel, and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the ragù is bubbling and the cheese has browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Let
            lasagne rest for 10 or 15 minutes at room temperature before slicing.</li>
        <li>Then, enjoy your tasty lasagne!</li>
