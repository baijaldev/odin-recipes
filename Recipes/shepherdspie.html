    <h4>What Is Shepherds Pie?</h4>
    <p>Shepherd's pie is a traditional British dish made with a layer of minced meat cooked with vegetables and gravy,
        topped with mashed potatoes and baked until golden. It is warm, filling, and often eaten as comfort food. The
        dish originated in the United Kingdom in the late 18th century as a way to use up leftover roasted meat.
        Originally, it was made with lamb, which is why it is called shepherd's pie.</p>
